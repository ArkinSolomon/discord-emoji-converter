# Discord Emoji Converter
Module to convert Discord emoji shortcodes (ex: "`:grinning:`" to "`ðŸ˜€`") to emoji characters, and vice versa.

This may work for other platforms, however they are built according to Discord's emoji shortcodes, which are not standard. This does not work for custom server emojis.
